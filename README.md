The Covid Puzzle Cube is an educational and fun puzzle box that serves to teach the user about quarantine etiquette. View the live demonstration of the cube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7beyGCJO7LQ)!

## Overview

This project was designed over the course of 8 weeks and built in 2 weeks as part of CS179J: Embedded Systems Senior Design, with a team of 5 members at UC Riverside. The Covid Puzzle Cube has 5 puzzles that all interact with each other and share data with a corresponding mobile app. The **full final report** is viewable [here](resources/Final_Report.pdf) with **in depth design and testing information**. This project was written using a combination of Python and CSS, the card dispenser was 3D printed.

## Future Developments

If we are to continue development on this project we would like to clean up the exterior with 3D printed exterior parts, and to give the cube a portable power source so it is more easily movable.
